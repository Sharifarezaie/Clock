# build-react-clock🔁

## Description 📜
The React Pomodoro Timer is a web-based application designed to help users manage their time efficiently by following the Pomodoro Technique. This technique divides work into intervals (typically 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break), making it easier to focus and maintain productivity.
This project aims to replicate the functionality of the 25 + 5 Clock provided by freeCodeCamp. The application is built using modern web technologies, primarily React, and includes all the necessary user stories and features to meet the project requirements.

## Features 🎉

- Break and Session Length Adjustment: Users can set custom lengths for their work sessions and breaks.
- Timer Display: The countdown is displayed in a mm:ss format and updates every second.
- Start/Stop Functionality: Users can start or pause the timer at any moment.
- Automatic Switching: The timer automatically switches between work sessions and breaks.
- Reset Functionality: Users can reset the timer to default settings at any time.
- Audio Alerts: A beep sound alerts the user when the timer reaches zero, indicating the end of a session or break.
